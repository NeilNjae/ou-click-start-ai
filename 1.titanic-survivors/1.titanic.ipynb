If we do that, we find that there are 386 women, of whom 290 (75%) survived, while there are 657 men of whom 135 (21%) survived. Therefore, we have a simple decision tree that asks \"is this person female?\"; if yes, we predict they survived; if no, we predict they died. When we combine these cases, we get a model that has an overall accuracy of 78%. The tree is shown below; the numbers in brackets show the number of people who died and survived respectively.\n",

If we use this question to determine our prediction, we should predict that the unaccompanied people died and the accompanied survived. This model has an overall accuracy of 62%, only marginally better than just saying everyone died. Again, this tree is below.\n",

We continue to grow the tree, splitting leaf nodes, until either all the people at that leaf are in the same category, there's nothing left to split them, or we reach some kind of limit to growing the tree.\n",

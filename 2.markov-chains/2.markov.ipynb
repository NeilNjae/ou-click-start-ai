Often, the sounds we make while speaking can have more that one interpretation (try saying quickly \"recognise speech\" and \"wreck a nice beach\" to someone, and ask them which is which). In these cases, having some idea of the likely words can help us disambiguate the sounds the machine hears. We can also use the predictability of language to detect spelling and grammar mistakes; a grammar checker can detect incongurous words and suggest them for revision.\n",

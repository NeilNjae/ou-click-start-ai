    "In this activity, you'll build a version of _ELIZA_, the first chatbot. \n",
    "\n",
    "An AI system that has conversations with people is commonly called a chatbot. You could well have encountered them as the first level of customer service for large companies, or the question-answering assistant in phones and smart speakers. Just like the term AI the chatbot has a long history. The first chatbot was ELIZA (Weizenbaum, 1966), which purported to be a psychotherapist. It worked by simple pattern matching on the text inputs it was given.\n",
    "\n",
    "ELIZA had a set of rules that specified some keywords in the input: if a rule matched the input, then the rule specified how to use it to create a response.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, consider if ELIZA had the rules specified below.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Pattern | Responses |\n",
    "|---------|-----------|\n",
    "| ?X I want ?Y | what would it mean if you got ?Y<br>why do you want ?Y<br>suppose you got ?Y soon |\n",
    "| ?X I am sad ?Y | I am sorry to hear you are depressed<br>I’m sure it’s not pleasant to be sad |\n",
    "| ?X are like ?Y | what resemblance do you see between ?X and ?Y |\n",
    "\n",
    "With these rules, the sentence \n",
    "\n",
    "> sometimes I want to be happy\n",
    "\n",
    "would match the first rule, with the variable `?Y` matching the fragment ‘to be happy’. \n",
    "\n",
    "| ?X | | ?Y |\n",
    "|----|-|----|\n",
    "|sometimes | I want | to be happy |\n",
    "\n",
    "ELIZA could use that information to respond with the sentence:\n",
    "\n",
    "> ‘Why do you want to be happy?’\n",
    "\n",
    "with the matched value for `?Y` filling out the response.\n",
    "\n",
    "Weizenbaum created ELIZA to show how text communication could be simulated by such superficial processing. However, he was surprised by how readily people took to ELIZA and engaged it in conversations that were meaningful to the person. ELIZA is simple enough that it’s easy to modify its behaviour, which you will do in this activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The state of the art of chatbots has moved on since the 1960s and tools like ChatGPT can now have conversations that seem like they are with a person. While ChatGPT is much more sophisticated than ELIZA, its basic operation remains the same: analyses its input, identifies the salient parts, and uses them to construct the response."

The _result_ of this process is for us to know which variables in a rule match which parts of the input; that information can be used to generate the output. The normal term for \"connecting a variable and its value\" is a _binding_. In the example above, we would say that the variable `?X` is _bound_ to the value \"sometimes\" and the variable `?Y` is _bound_ to the value \"to be happy\".

    "Chatbots have been around since the very dawn of computers. Modern conversational agents work in very differently from this approach, but the very high-level overview of the process is the same. The rules in ELIZA are a form of language model, but one that combines both understanding its input and generating its output. The chatbot uses that language model to \"understand\" what the user says to it, then \"decides\" how to form a response. The fact that ELIZA works at all is down to two key features. One is the very restrictive domain of discourse; ELIZA simulates a [Rogerian psychotherapist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person-centered_therapy) who only reflects back what the patient says. The other is the human propensity to anthropomorphise most things around us. People talk; ELIZA talks; therefore ELIZA must be some kind of person. It's an easy trap to fall into, to beware of it when you see other AI-generated text online."
